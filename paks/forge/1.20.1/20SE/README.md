# SquirrelPAK 20SE - Special Edition

> Last call for 1.20.1! - Last PAK for 1.20.1, you don't have to play it but you really should!

In our last PAK (really this time) of the 1.20.1 series we reviewed all the modes in 20KS (Kitchen Sink) and then we hand picked the very best mods. Next we cloned 20VP (Vanilla Plus) removed some mods, added all the best mods, and on stream tested and tweaked this perfect ending to 1.20.1 PAK series. This PAK is special and thats why we called it 20SE - Special Edition
  
This PAK is special because it has all good stuff without the fluff. We looked at our first PAK MC12, and we looked to see why we loved that PAK so much. That guided us to pick just the right mods from 1.20.1 Kitchen Sink PAK. We tested the alpha builds on stream over at our YouTube channel, and the result is this very Special Edition of SquirrelPAK for 1.20.1 

We will also be streaming a Lets Play on our YouTube channel using this PAK to finish out our Lets Play 1.20.1 series.  

For the full mod list in the pack check out the Mod Pack Deps page for up to date list.

This is truly the last PAK in the 1.20.1 seres, we promise! Why? Because we are working on 1.21 and have no more time for 1.20.1 development.
